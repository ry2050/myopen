      <h2>2. Data We May Collect</h2>

      <h3>2.1 Data You Provide</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>We do not collect or upload any content you create in the App. All data stays on your device.</li>
        <li>Support communications: only if you contact us by email. We receive the information you choose to share.

      </ul>

      <h3>2.2 Automatically Collected Technical Data</h3>
      <p>
        To provide and manage subscription services, we use <strong>RevenueCat</strong>. RevenueCat collects certain
        data to process and validate your subscriptions, which may include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Anonymous Device Identifiers (such as App User ID).</li>
        <li>Transaction history and receipt information from the App Store or Google Play Store.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Aside from subscription-related data, this App does not collect analytics data or device identifiers for
        marketing purposes.
      </p>

      <h3>2.3 Permission-Based Data</h3>
      <p>
        The current version of this App does not request or use any system permissions, including but not limited to
        camera, photos, microphone, notifications, or location.
      </p>
      <p class="muted">
        If future versions introduce features that require system permissions,
        we will clearly notify users in the App and update this Privacy Policy accordingly.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>3. How We Use Your Data</h2>
      <p>We do not collect personal data in the current version of the App, so we do not use personal data.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>4. Third-Party Services & Sharing</h2>
      <p>We use the following third-party services to operate the App:</p>

          processing. You can find their privacy policy at <a href="https://www.revenuecat.com/privacy"

          distribution.</li>

    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>5. Data Retention & Deletion</h2>
      <p>We do not collect or store personal data in the current version of the App, so there is no data retention or
        deletion process.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>6. Security</h2>
      <p>We do not collect or store personal data in the App. If you contact us by email, we use reasonable safeguards
        to protect those communications. However, no method is 100% secure.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>7. Children’s Privacy</h2>
      <p>The Service is not intended for children under 13 (or as defined by local laws). If you believe a child
        contacted us and shared personal data, please contact us to delete it.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>8. Your Rights</h2>
      <p>Because we do not collect personal data in the App, most data access, correction, or deletion rights are not
        applicable. If you contact us by email, you may request deletion of those communications.</p>
