        This Privacy Policy applies to <strong>SubMan</strong> (the “Service” or “App”).

      <h2>2. Data We May Collect</h2>

      <h3>2.1 Data You Provide</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>We do not collect or upload any content you create in the App. All data stays on your device.</li>
        <li>Support communications: only if you contact us by email. We receive the information you choose to share.
        </li>
        <li>If you contact us by email, we receive only the information you voluntarily provide.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>2.2 Automatically Collected Technical Data (via RevenueCat)</h3>
      <p>
        To process and validate subscriptions, the App uses <strong>RevenueCat</strong>, which may collect:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Anonymous device identifiers (e.g., App User ID)</li>
        <li>App Store / Google Play transaction history and receipt information.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Aside from subscription-related processing, the App:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>does not collect analytics data</li>
        <li>does not collect advertising identifiers</li>
        <li>does not track users and device identifiers for marketing purposes</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>2.3 Permission-Based Data</h3>
      <p>
        The current version of the App does <strong>not</strong> request any system permissions (camera, photos,
        microphone, notifications, location, etc.).
      </p>
      <p>If future versions introduce features requiring permissions, users will be clearly notified and this Policy
        will be updated.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>3. Legal Basis for Processing (GDPR)</h2>
      <p>Although the App does not collect personal data, subscription-related processing by RevenueCat relies on the
        following legal bases:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Performance of a contract:</strong> validating purchases and providing paid features</li>
        <li><strong>Legitimate interest:</strong> responding to user support emails</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>4. How We Use Your Data</h2>
      <p>Because the App does not collect personal data, we do not use personal data for analytics, marketing,
        profiling, or any other purpose. Subscription-related data processed by RevenueCat is used solely to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>verify purchases</li>
        <li>manage entitlements</li>
        <li>enable paid features</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>5. Third-Party Services & Data Sharing</h2>

      <h3>5.1 RevenueCat (Processor)</h3>
      <p>Used for subscription management and entitlement verification.
        Privacy Policy: https://www.revenuecat.com/privacy
      </p>
      <h3>5.2 Apple App Store & Google Play Store (Independent Controllers)</h3>
      <p>Used for payment processing and app distribution.
        They may process transaction data independently according to their own policies.
      </p>
      <h3>5.3 No Data Selling</h3>
      <p>We do not sell or share your data with third parties for advertising or marketing.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>5. Data Retention & Deletion</h2>
      <p>We do not collect or store personal data in the current version of the App, so there is no data retention or
        deletion process.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>6. International Data Transfers</h2>
      <p>Subscription-related data processed by RevenueCat may be transferred to servers located outside your country,
        including the United States. RevenueCat implements industry-standard safeguards to protect such data.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>6. Data Retention & Deletion</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>The App does not collect or store personal data on servers.</li>
        <li>Therefore, we do not retain or delete App data on your behalf.</li>
        <li>If you contact us by email, you may request deletion of those communications.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>7. Children’s Privacy</h2>
      <p>The Service is not intended for children under 13 (or as defined by local laws). If you believe a child
        contacted us and shared personal data, please contact us to delete it.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>8. Security</h2>
      <p>We do not store personal data from the App. For email communications, we apply reasonable safeguards, but no
        method of transmission is 100% secure.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>9. Children’s Privacy</h2>
      <p>The Service is not intended for children under 13 (or as defined by local laws). If a child contacts us and
        provides personal data, you may request deletion via email.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>10. Your Rights (GDPR / CCPA)</h2>
      <p>Because the App does not collect personal data, most rights (access, correction, deletion, portability) do not
        apply. However, if you are located in the EU or California, you may still contact us regarding your rights under
        GDPR or CCPA.</p>
      <p>We will respond by confirming that:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>the App does not collect personal data</li>
        <li>all App data is stored only on your device</li>
        <li>uninstalling the App removes all locally stored data</li>
      </ul>
      <p>For email communications, you may request deletion at any time.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>11. Cookies & Tracking</h2>
      <p>The App does <strong>not</strong> use:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>cookies</li>
        <li>tracking technologies</li>
        <li>advertising identifiers</li>
        <li>analytics SDKs</li>
      </ul>
    </div>


    <div class="card">
      <h2>12. Future Changes to Data Practices</h2>
      <p>Future versions of the App may introduce optional features requiring additional data processing. Any such
        changes will be clearly disclosed, and consent will be requested when required.
      </p>
    </div>


    <div class="card">
      <h2>13. Updates to This Policy</h2>
